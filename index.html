			<h2>Malatya, TR</h2>
			<p>
				"Though most of my extended family is from Malatya, I was born in Malatya. Malatya, the site of ancient Melitene lies a few kilometres from the modern city in what is now the village of Arslantepe and near the district center of Battalgazi (Byzantine to Ottoman Empire). Present-day Battalgazi was the location of the city of Malatya until the 19th century, when a gradual move of the city to the present third location began. Battalgazi's official name was Eskimalatya (Old Malatya); until recently, it was a name used locally. In Turkey the city is renowned for its apricots, as up to 80% of the Turkish apricot production is provided by Malatya, giving Malatya the name kayısı diyarı ("apricot realm").Still, it's a beautiful place that I still like to claim as my original home."

				<h2>Guangzhou, CN</h2>
				<p>
					"Guangzhou known as Canton and alternately romanized as Kwangchow, is the capital and most populous city of the province of Guangdong in southern China. Located on the Pearl River about 120 km (75 mi) north-northwest of Hong Kong and 145 km (90 mi) north of Macau, Guangzhou has a history of over 2,200 years and was a major terminus of the maritime Silk Road, and continues to serve as a major port and transportation hub, as well as one of China's three largest cities. Long the only Chinese port accessible to most foreign traders, Guangzhou was captured by the British during the First Opium War. No longer enjoying a monopoly after the war, it lost trade to other ports such as Hong Kong and Shanghai, but continued to serve as a major transshipment port. Due to a high urban population and large volumes of port traffic, Guangzhou is classified as a Large-Port Megacity, the largest type of port-city in the world. Guangzhou has a humid climate. I loved chinese food especially Guangzhou Sea Restaurant."

It was one of the fastest-growing cities in the world in the 1990s and the 2000s. Shenzhen's registered population as of 2017 was estimated at 12,905,000 but local police and authorities estimate the real population at about 20 million due, to large populations of short-term residents, unregistered floating migrants, part-time residents, commuters, visitors, as well as other temporary residents. i have been two years in Shenzhen. I have many friends there. If i have chance , I want to live in Shenzhen. City is between Hong Kong and Guangzhou. only a hour rar away each city. There is fast speed train between those cities."
